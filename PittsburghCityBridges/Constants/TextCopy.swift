This Pittsburgh City Bridges app contains information on over 140 bridges publicly available from the City of Pittsburgh Bridges OpenData database.

These city bridges cross roads, ravines, and streams. They are old bridges, new bridges, small, medium and large bridges.

None span the rivers save two, the Fort Duquesne Pedestrian Bridge and the Hot Metal Pedestrian Bridge. Both can be found in this app.

Bridge information provided includes bridge name, neighborhood, year built, gps location, and photos.

App Maker makes no guarantee about accuracy of data contained in the City of Pittsburgh Bridges publicly available dataset. Use at your own risk.

Because for example, the Fern Hollow bridge is still shown in the dataset as intact. The Year Built and Images are missing for some bridges. And App Maker has no way to verify the GPS coordinates or even existence of all 140 bridges. Overall though there is a lot of good data.

App Maker has found this to be an educational and even entertaining app. It is presented to the community free of charge.
