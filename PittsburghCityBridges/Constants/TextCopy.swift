This Pittsburgh City Bridges app contains information on over 140 bridges publicly available from the City of Pittsburgh Bridges Open Data database.

This app was created by one iOS developer as a so-called portfolio app to showcase using some of the latest iOS software features. The City of Pittsburgh Bridges database was selected because there "wasn't an App for that". App development work began in late 2021, never imagining the Fern Hollow Bridge would soon collapse in January 2022.

The bridges in this app cross roads, ravines, and streams and are understood to be city maintained bridges.

This app does not have the major bridges that cross any of the three rivers because they are not in the City of Pittsburgh Bridges Open Data database.

This app is provided to the community free of charge.
